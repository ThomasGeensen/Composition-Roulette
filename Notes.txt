Random function should happen in PYTHON so I can specify a specific range of numbers from a dictionary from which to
pick a random number which will then be used in a query as an ID number. This way the categorization can happen within
the dictionary

OR

the random row will be selected by SQLITE3 so I can use SQL commands (group by, etc) to handle the categorization
but this might not work considering SQL's random function is done by "ORDER BY RANDOM()"

try both see what works best



Version 0.0.1:
    Ability to return a random instrument from a database (CompositionRoulette.db) into console
